# Art Prompt Generator

"What should I draw?"
"What should I write about?"

Familiar questions that the creatively-inclined will face at one point or another. A lack of inspiration is the artist's
worst enemy.

This project is a rudamentary writing / art prompt generator that pulls from lists of `adjectives`, `nouns`, `verbs`, and 
short phrases that act as `settings / environments` and turns them into short, randomly-generated descriptions. 

The maximum amount of prompts that can be generated per run is 10; this techinically COULD be increased, but this limit
is intentionally imposed to avoid "choice paralysis" and encourage the user to go with the first prompt that inspires them.


Here are some samples:

```
- An evil doctor with a rope hiding in a library.
- A glamorous magician with a jaguar standing on a mountain.
- A concentrated wizard with a wolf playing chess in front of a sunrise.
- A depressive jester with a flask playing cards in an alley.
```
